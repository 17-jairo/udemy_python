The main error was the non use of parenthesis, which is necessary if we are going to receive negative numbers
in the calculus.

import math

# Input coefficients from the user
a = int(input("Insert the coefficient A: "))
b = int(input("Insert the coefficient B: "))
c = int(input("Insert the coefficient C: "))

# Check if it's a second-degree equation (a != 0)
if a != 0:
    # Calculate the discriminant
    delt = b**2 - 4*a*c

    # Check if the roots are complex numbers
    if delt < 0:
        print("Square roots are complex numbers.")
    # If the discriminant is zero, there's a single real root
    elif delt == 0:
        x1 = -b / (2 * a)
        print(f"Unique root: x = {x1}")
    # If the discriminant is positive, there are two real roots
    else:
        x1 = (-b + math.sqrt(delt)) / (2 * a)
